# Project
Emma Pesjak

## Environment & Tools
The project was performed on a Windows 10 PC with WebStorm 2021.2.3, HTML5, CSS3, JS and Git version 2.33.0.windows.2.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to create a web application by applying the knowledge gained of HTML5, CSS3 
and JavaScript in this course.

## Procedures

To begin this project, the index.html file was created. All the HTML for grade E-B was added according to the 
project guidance. The `<canvas>` was added during the grade A-implementations. A head and a body was added, and in 
the head; metadata, title and links to the stylesheet, favicon and script were added. In the body, sections for 
header, main and footer were added. The header contained the logo and title. The main section was divided into 
four subsections according to the grade E requirements. For part 3.1.2 and grade C-B a checkbox for an ignore 
casing option, radio buttons for language and a dropdown select menu were added, each with names, IDs, and/or types
in their HTML-elements. For part 3.1.3 a section with text details in different `<h>` or `<p>` elements were added.
For the input and start/stop button section in 3.1.4 a text input field and a button was simply added. For the 3.1.5 
statistics section `<p>` elements containing the statistics information were added. This was also where 
the `<canvas>` was later added. Lastly, copyright information and an e-mail link was added to the footer. 

Once the HTML was roughly finished, the CSS work began. In order to get the background image to always cover the page, the background properties were set to cover, be centered and the HTML minimum height was set to 100%. Margins were set to 0 on the body and the max-width was set to 600px to conform with the project guidance. To get the header to look good, the logo and header text were set in a grid with two columns. Two different fonts were added to the font folder and with `@font-face` these were implemented in the CSS. Font weight and style were set for both. 
The settings and statistics sections were also put in a grid to comply with the layout stated in the project guidance. Also over all most element were given different paddings, margins, borders, fonts and styling.
The button attributes were set to transparent and with no border in order to only show the image.
the input textbox placeholder focus was set to transparant to make the text not show on focus.
The footer got a top-border to cleary sepaarate it form the rest of the content.
classes for incorrect, correct and next character background were added.
the animation on the header was implemented with `@key-frames`, changing the colour and position.

## Discussion

Knowing I was aiming for grade A.... decided to implement everything, started by doing all html and then css.
the most challengeing part of thiss project was the grade B implementation, to get the XML working


först html och css
sen typsnitt och animation i D-delen
sen drop downen

logikfel med minuspoäng i net WPM, därav alltid minst 0..

visste från början att jag ville göra upp till A..
